Somewhere in a tower roams a horrid ghoulish beast
He lusts for pain and misery wherever it's released
He's very old and wrinkly, there's no doubt he is insane
He's never had compassion, Uncle Rupert is his name

You're welcome to the show
Hope you've no place to go
Mindless and in a trance
Watch all his puppets dance

And when he's finished playing
puts them neatly in their box
Some people say he's crazy – yes,
he's crazy like a Fox

He watches while the forests burn,
he cannot stand the poor
His propaganda rules the streets,
he's always wanting more
The mining trolls and poisoned souls
who play the corporate game
The politicians that he owns will never take blame

You're welcome to the show
Hope you've no place to go
Mindless and in a trance
Watch all his puppets dance

Feel him pulling at your strings his power grows and grows
Take a bow and force a smile for Uncle Rupert's Puppet Show
