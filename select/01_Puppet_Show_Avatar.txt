Puppet king, oh, puppet king
When you sleep do you dream of control?
Everything, run by strings
Your shadow has a voice of its own
Oh
Puppet king, oh, puppet king
Have your subjects found out that you're dead?
Whispers sing in the wind
The puppet mob has come for your head
Oh, puppet show
Oh, puppet show
Puppet king, oh, puppet king
The end is near, the curtains comes down
Hear them sing, dance and drink
A puppet king without a puppet crown
Oh, puppet show
Oh, puppet show
Oh
Puppet king, oh, puppet king
Puppet king, oh, puppet king
All the children sing
Of a crownless king
When children sing
Then you will know
The puppet show
Oh
Puppet show
