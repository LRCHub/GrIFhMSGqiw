Yeah
Had to tell 'em one time for the kids who don't know
Yeah
Abstract what up
Yeah
AZ
Yeah

Just had a call with Atlantic
I got 'em all in a panic
All in my ear, they know it's my year
Just get me a chair, I can't stand it
They know that I'ma be poppin'
With all of this fire I'm droppin'
I am so nice, no red and blue lights, but you know that they gonna cop it, yeah
Back on my bullshit, back in my zone
I got these labels all hitting my phone
I got my fans, I don't give a damn, bro, I just be doing this shit on my own
Started with nothing I made it to something
Now I just been growin' and growin', yeah
I'm gettin' older, my bars gettin' colder
Yeah, they say I flow like it's snowin'
Now I drink some to keep balance
These tings loving my talents, heh
She keeps sending me Texas, your girl a cowboy, no Dallas, ha!
Bet that went over your head, yeah!
I bet that you did not notice (no!), yeah!
I see my life through a lens (woo!)
You have been way out of focus, uh!
I'm taking my time, my name on the line, no, you will not get that from me
They need to chill, and I need a mill
Bro, I am not working for free, yeah
I spit these facts, ain't taking it back
'Cause I got the buzz like I'm tasting the jack
I do the walking while you do the talking
And I'm making moves while you taking a nap, agh!

I gotta let 'em know
Industry look like a puppet show
Who's pullin' your strings?
Whose phone did you ring?
I have no Geppetto, I'm on my own!
I came in knowing nobody
Now the whole team in the lobby
Labels got me on the phone
But offers ain't even close

Nah, I'm gonna need a lot more than that
So that's good day, I'll tip my cap
Seen the type of cats you workin' with
No, it ain't been workin', sinkin' ship
All their songs been boring since the hit
Got the whole world snoring on your pitch
Coulda saved y'all time, ain't that a bitch?
They went viral over night, one-night stand gone before the morning
When y'all gonna finally get to learnin'?
Though their candle's lit, no wax for burnin'
They ain't here for longevity, zero integrity
Gotta be kiddin' me, hits? I got seventy
I'm on the mezzanine looking down on it like "Damn"
"They shoulda came with a plan"
If you sign me, sign the whole team
Rappers actin' like we siamese
We are not the same, I got hits in every genre of the game
Folk on my album it's gettin' plays
Voicemail on my phone, but I make 'em wait
I ain't pullin' my chips, no, I came to play
I mean, look at the hand that I made, I'm okay!

This ain't Tolkien, why would I have to return the ring?
Maybe I'll jump to the third, 'cause now it's Return of the King
This is on purpose
I swear I'm planning out everything
I'm a step ahead, put the talk to bed
Orbit with the heat, planets in my head, agh!

I gotta let 'em know
Industry look like a puppet show
Who's pullin' your strings?
Whose phone did you ring?
I have no Geppetto, I'm on my own!
I came in knowing nobody
Now the whole team in the lobby
