Looking, laughing, talking all your sh*t
Wondering if you live your life just so you can fit
Could it be real
Or you're a fake
Nobody's that way ... Give me a fucking break
No recognition is what we should give
To people like this that tell me how to live
The ones who crticize, they gossip and they smile,
The people that live the way that they decide
This is not a puppet show
No one in the world is hanging on a string
Take a look around, there are people everywhere
They might be doing circles but it's their own thing.
